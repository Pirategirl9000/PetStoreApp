/*

• include your group member’s full names and repo URL in each class
• using protected access modifier when appropriate
• date field
• 2 derived classes. Possible suggestions: Fish, Bird, etc.
• 2 unique fields per derived class. Possible suggestions:
• 1 or 2 enums applied at either the base or derived class level
• Example at the base level:
• HabitatType: CAGE, AQUARIUM, TERRARIUM, OPEN_SPACE
• FeedingSchedule: ONCE_DAILY, TWICE_DAILY, THREE_TIMES_DAILY, WEEKLY,
BIWEEKLY
• Example at the derived class level: BodyShape, NestType, MigrationPattern
• 2 packages
• Package that stores the classes & enums related to inventory data
• Package that stores the classes for managing the user’s interface
• A user-friendly interface for managing the Pet’s store inventory
which allows:
• adding inventory
• deleting inventory
• display the inventory in a column structured list using printf
• saving the inventory to a text file, using piped delimited
• loading the inventory from a text file, using piped delimited
• UML diagram as a JPG file (also checked into GitHub)
• Optional (extra credit points):
• 5 points = updating inventory
• 5 points = properly written README.md
• 5 points = properly written JavaDoc
Do NOT try to code the whole project before testing. Incremental development is key!
• Step 1: code and test the base class (optionally enum at the base level)
• Step 2: code and test 1st of the derived classes (optionally enum at the derived level)
• Step 3: code and test the PetStoreApp user-interface for only one of your inventory types
• Step 4: code and test the 2nd derived class, enum, and update the PetStoreApp user-interface
